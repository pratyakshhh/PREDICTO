## 📸 What it does

- Select any two of the **48 World Cup 2026 teams** from a dropdown
- Adjust each team's recent form using a slider
- Hit **Predict** and get:
  - Win / Draw / Loss prediction with confidence level
  - Probability breakdown across all three outcomes
  - Full **head-to-head historical record** between the two teams
  - Model performance metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC AUC)

## 🧠 How it works

### Data
- **~32,000 international football matches** from 1990–2024
- Source: [Kaggle — International football results from 1872](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017) by martj42

### Features engineered
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `home_team_enc` | Home team encoded as integer |
| `away_team_enc` | Away team encoded as integer |
| `home_form` | Home team win rate over last 10 matches |
| `away_form` | Away team win rate over last 10 matches |
| `form_diff` | Difference in form between the two teams |
| `home_h2h_rate` | Home team's historical win rate vs this specific opponent |
| `is_neutral` | Whether the match is at a neutral venue (0 or 1) |

### Models compared
| Model | Test Accuracy |
|---|---|
| Gradient Boosting | ~54.5% |
| Random Forest | ~54.1% |
| Logistic Regression | ~53.8% |
| KNN | ~47.4% |

Best model selected automatically and saved for the app.

> 📊 ~54% accuracy is realistic for football — even professional bookmakers rarely exceed 65% on 3-outcome prediction. Random guessing gives 33%.
